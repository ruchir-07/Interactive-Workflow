## **Features**

1. **Workflow Builder**:
   - Drag-and-drop interface for creating workflows.
   - Add and connect nodes of various types: Start, Task, Decision, and End.
   - Edit node properties, such as labels and execution time.

2. **Workflow Management**:
   - Save workflows to local storage.
   - Load previously saved workflows.
   - Export workflows as JSON files.
   - Import workflows from JSON files.

3. **Analytics Dashboard**:
   - Visualize workflow execution data using:
     - Bar Chart: Execution time for each node.
     - Line Chart: Cumulative execution time.
     - Pie Chart: Node type distribution.

4. **Validation**:
   - Validate workflow structure (e.g., a single Start and End node).

5. **Responsive Design**:
   - Works seamlessly across devices with dynamic layout adjustments.

## **Usage**

1. **Workflow Builder**:
   - Add nodes (Start, Task, Decision, End) using the Node Palette.
   - Connect nodes by dragging edges between them.
   - Edit node properties in the sidebar.

2. **Workflow Management**:
   - Save the workflow to local storage using the **Save Workflow** button.
   - Load previously saved workflows using the **Load Workflow** button.
   - Export workflows as JSON files using the **Export Workflow** button.
   - Import workflows from JSON files using the **Import Workflow** button.

3. **Analytics Dashboard**:
   - Navigate to `/analytics` to view visualizations of the current workflow.

## **Key Functionalities**

### **Node Palette**
- Add nodes of different types.
- Save, load, export, and import workflows.

### **Node Sidebar**
- Edit node properties (e.g., label, execution time).
- Delete nodes and associated connections.

### **Canvas**
- Drag-and-drop interface for managing nodes and connections.
- Zoom and pan controls for better navigation.

### **Analytics Dashboard**
- View workflow data visualizations:
  - Bar Chart: Execution time for each node.
  - Line Chart: Cumulative execution time.
  - Pie Chart: Node type distribution.

## **Example Workflow JSON**

### Sample Exported JSON
```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "node-1",
      "type": "Start",
      "data": { "label": "Start Node", "executionTime": 0 },
      "position": { "x": 100, "y": 200 }
    },
    {
      "id": "node-2",
      "type": "Task",
      "data": { "label": "Task Node", "executionTime": 5 },
      "position": { "x": 200, "y": 300 }
    }
  ],
  "edges": [
    {
      "source": "node-1",
      "target": "node-2"
    }
  ]
}
```

## **Future Enhancements**

1. **Undo/Redo Functionality**:
   - Allow users to revert or reapply workflow changes.

2. **Execution Simulation**:
   - Animate the execution flow of nodes.

3. **Real-Time Collaboration**:
   - Enable multiple users to collaborate on the same workflow.

4. **Custom Node Types**:
   - Allow users to define and add custom node types.

5. **Authentication**:
   - Save workflows to the cloud for authenticated users.
